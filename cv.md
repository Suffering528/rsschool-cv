# *So, about me*

I'm 23 y.o., on start of my way in life, so I'm trying to find my path in this life.

I've been working a lot in Investigation department AKA (Следственный комитет), for a year since 2019 to 2020 and got a lot of interesting expirience

Then, i've been working for 5 element as salesmen for about 6 months and while I was working there I found the love of my heart, my wife, who was sent to Rogachev to work after university as a dentist-surgeon and here I am now.

For now I'am working as a Lawyer for КЖЭУП "Рогачев" and looking for a new perspectives, 

Life as a Lawyer is a little bit weird, coz it's very hard to improve your skills and this work always keep you in stress, so i decided to find another work which would make me happy, coz I love computers and always dreamt about work with them.

Also, my first idea was to enter the IT in university after school, but because of math, I could fail the exams, so I decided to go another way (actually I was happy after graduating)

So, as I said earlier, i wish to work with computers, coz I love how it works, all those process inside the machine, thats unbeliveble <3 

My whole life was spent to learn new about those complex devices, so, I want to learn more about them, thats why I am here.

I feel, like i can influnce on processes inside the computer and also i can show my work for the people, who can estimate my work.

# *About my abillities*

All i can say, I'am very attentive person, all those tiny things (i can see them :D), I like to study, learn smthn new, and also, what is important for IT sphere, I like to communicate with people, and what also important, I know how to communicate (Hope so c:)

Before the rsschool, I study HTML, CSS and JS for some time, and also was looking for a job as a tester, but, my friend changed my mind and I start studing Front-end.

Also I complete ITEA academy courses and after them i achived a certificate, but I was studing as a software tester.

# *Here is my code example*

` const digits = n => n.toString().length; `

For some reason I would like to tell, that I also can play guitar, sometimes drawing and playing video games for fun, which  improve my language skills (learned talk-english there and at school)

I guess there must be something else, but I cant even imagine what could be usefull for my future job :D
